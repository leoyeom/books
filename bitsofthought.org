* a day of ordinary life.
***  <2013-05-15 ìˆ˜> // Shiny, not hot.

 A new day as always.  Expect a fine day. I am not good at English. So bad for me, but why so serious about it.

Using a emacs is not easy 4 me. I have few knowledge of programming or editor nor developing environment. There are manuals and books about emacs, I have no idea what shoud i do after all the black and white on screen and papers.


... but I am writing this log with emacs. why?

I just simply don't know. But when I saw the name, emacs in the book,[[http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer] [pragmatic programmer]], my heart keep calling emacs.

I just can't help it.
